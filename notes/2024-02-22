Meeting Notes: February 22, 2024

Attendees: Jack, Mark, Rowan, Emily

Agenda:

Additional arguments: time variable, number of visits.
Extra fancy(!): table of unique subjects for 1, 2, 3, 4, etc visits.
Linking tests within a range vs before or after a particular anchor visit.
Functions: import/clean, descriptives, distributions, analysis.
Plots: spaghetti, covariance matrix, etc.
Composite metrics outputs.
Incorporation of notes into the macro repository.
Development of a function with arguments: predictor and outcome for creating longitudinal subsets.
Discussion Highlights:

Additional Arguments:

Explored incorporating time variables and the number of visits into the analysis for enhanced insights.

Extra Fancy Table:

Discussed creating a table displaying unique subjects for different numbers of visits (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) to aid in analysis.

Linking Tests:

Considered methods for linking tests within a range versus before or after a particular anchor visit to better understand the data dynamics.

Functions:

Identified the need for key functions such as import/clean, descriptives, distributions, and analysis to streamline the workflow.
Plots:

Proposed generating various plots including spaghetti plots, covariance matrix, etc., to visualize data patterns effectively.

Composite Metrics:

Discussed the generation of composite metrics outputs to provide comprehensive insights into the data analysis.

Repository Incorporation:

Agreed to integrate meeting notes and developed functions into the macro repository for centralized access and organization.

Function Development:

Outlined the creation of a function with arguments for predictors and outcomes to generate longitudinal subsets including all analytic variables with recalculated time since baseline, baseline age, and baseline covariates.

Action Items:

Jack to explore incorporating time variables and the number of visits into the analysis.
Mark to investigate ggally for potential integration into the analysis workflow.
Collaboratively work on creating extra fancy tables showcasing unique subjects for different numbers of visits.
Experiment with linking tests within a range versus before or after a particular anchor visit.
Develop and streamline key functions for import/clean, descriptives, distributions, and analysis.
Create plots including spaghetti plots, covariance matrix, etc., for data visualization.
Explore generating composite metrics outputs for comprehensive insights.
Integrate meeting notes and developed functions into the macro repository.
Develop a function with arguments for predictors and outcomes to create longitudinal subsets with all analytic variables.

Next Meeting: Walk through join_list_of_dfs function.
